# JarvisIA
JarvisIA is an idea of Daniel Dieser @initiasur, @NiperiaLab, independent robotics researcher and I.A. JarvisIA is the first voice assistant in Spanish and was created to encourage the use and development of Artificial Intelligence technologies among Latinos. The collaborators of this development are a very crazy and cool team that were students of programming and hacking of Daniel Dieser in the city of Puerto Madryn, Argentina. They are: Dante Vargas, Cristian Aparicio, Mauricio Vega, Pichu and Matias Gimenez

To start cloning the repository, you can run this code in ubuntu in a PC or in a raspberry pi.
Once cloned, execute the file: speakyou.py in the following way: python3 speakyou.py
There surely you will have errors since you will have to install all the dependencies, to install them execute the following: sudo pip3 install "and the name of the library". This is if you are in python3 but: sudo pip install "and the name of the library". You must install python pip before.

Once you install everything you must create an app in wit.ai.
Enter wit and create your app with the entities that you want, you can look at the file: "jarvispoc.py" so that you create the entities as they are created there, if you are new in this it suits you to do it that way.

JarvisIA can work with wit.ai or you can have your own speech to text, wit.ai is a very good alternative if you are starting and will allow you to understand the Natural Language for Developers, that way you can translate your voice that is recorded to the file test1.wav
